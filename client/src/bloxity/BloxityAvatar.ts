 *
 *  - the SKIN, as a texture swap on the rider's own material;
 *  - the HAT and the BACK item, as meshes parented to real bones;
 *  - the PROPORTIONS, as scales and offsets on those same bones.
 *
 * The body PARTS are not applied here: those replace geometry on the body
 * itself and so belong to whatever built it - see `BloxityRiderFactory`. This
 * class dresses whichever rider is currently mounted, Bloxity body or bundled
 * `player.fbx`, which is why `rebind` exists.
 *
 * Every asset path comes from Bloxity's item catalogue rather than from a
 * pattern spelled out here. An id is looked up, its `assetPaths` are used
 * verbatim, and an item the catalogue does not know is simply not worn.

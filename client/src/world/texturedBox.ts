 *
 * This is what lets the whole floor - a hundred-odd slabs of wildly different
 * lengths - be merged into a single mesh with a single material and still have
 * studs the same size everywhere. Without it, a 190-unit runway and a 9-unit
 * island would each stretch one copy of the texture over themselves and the
 * ground would visibly change scale at every seam.
 *
 * `BoxGeometry` lays its 24 vertices out face by face in a fixed order -
 * +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z - and each face's UVs run 0..1. Rewriting them per
 * face with the two dimensions that face actually spans is the whole trick.
 *
 * @param tile world units one repeat of the texture covers
